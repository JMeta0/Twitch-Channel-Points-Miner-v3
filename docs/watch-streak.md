# Watch streaks

[Back to the README](../README.md)

The miner prioritizes a streamer with a pending watch streak so the streak is
not missed. A pending streak can temporarily bypass `points_limit`.

Before treating a streak as pending, the miner checks Twitch's milestone for the
current broadcast. A streak already awarded before startup, or on a first visit,
is therefore not farmed again.

## Logical streams

Twitch counts a broadcast that starts less than 30 minutes after the previous
one ended as the same stream for watch-streak purposes. A claim made on any
broadcast in that chain covers the current broadcast, so the miner does not farm
it again. The history dashboard uses the same rule when it shows whether the
live broadcast's streak was claimed.

The gap is defined by `WATCH_STREAK_STREAM_GAP_SECONDS` (30 minutes) in
`TwitchChannelPointsMiner/constants.py`.

## `streak_only`

Set `streak_only` in `StreamerSettings` to watch a channel only for its watch
streak:

```python
STREAMERS = [
    Streamer(
        "some-channel",
        settings=StreamerSettings(streak_only=True),
    ),
]
```

With `streak_only=True`, each broadcast is watched for at most about 10 minutes.
The channel is left once the streak is claimed, so no extra watch-time points
are farmed there. A counted broadcast needs only a few minutes, so
multi-broadcast streaks advance without camping the whole stream.

Set an integer to override the per-broadcast window in minutes:

```python
StreamerSettings(streak_only=5)
```

`streak_only` defaults to `False`.
